# Traveling Salesman Problem - evolutionary algorithm

## how to run the script
- on a computer with python installed with the files on the working directory run python script.py arg1 arg2 where 
- arg1 = size in vertexes of the graph (randomly generated)
- arg2 = number of generations that the algorithm will run
through in order to evolve using its mutate function and its own artificial selection methods.
